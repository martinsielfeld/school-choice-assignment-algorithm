# School Assignment Algorithms

The School Assignment Algorithms package (SAA) offers a flexible set of functions to perform students-to-school matching mechanisms, based on a wide range of rules, priotities and quotas specifications. General matching modeles perfomed by the ```baseSAA``` functions includes: 

* The Boston Assignment Mechanism[^1] (Abdulkadiroğlu, A., & Sönmez, T.,2003).
* The Deferred Acceptance Mechanism [^2] (Gale, D., & Shapley, L. S.,1962).
* Variations of said algorithms based on a priority criteria.

The ```baseSAA``` function  v1.0.0 allows for the following mechanism characteristics:

  * Base student-to-school matching mechanism, based on a priority order.
  * Prioritize students based on N number of different priority groups.
  * Allows for hard quotas (no soft quotas supported in this version).
  * Admission probabilites statistics.
  * Cutoffs statistics.
  * Seats statistics.

## Functions

### baseSAA

The base School Assaginment Algorithm (SAA) function performs a basic student-to-school matching procedure based on applications, capacities, and a set of parameters.

Argument | Description | Categories
-------- | ---------- | ----------
apps | Applications dataframe |
vacs | Capacities dataframe |
iters | Number of iterations |
seed | Seed for randomization |
get_wl | Get waitinglist in each iteration | True <br> False
get_assignment | Get assignment in each iteration | True <br> False
get_cutoffs | Get cutoffs in each iteration | True <br> False
